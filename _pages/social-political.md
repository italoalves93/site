# Essential Course Information

## Course Description

This course will provide an introductory exploration of the field of social and political philosophy, which grapples with questions about the nature of society, power, justice, and the state. It will offer a critical examination of the foundations of social and political theories, as well as the values that guide them, and it is designed for students with an interest in understanding the underlying foundations of modern political systems and the ways in which these foundations shape our contemporary world. The first part of the course will focus on modern political philosophy, which revolves around questions involving the justification of the state, the concept of natural rights, the role of private property, and various forms of government. We will examine the social contract theory of the state and the early socialist and anarchist critiques of this theory. The second part will explore contemporary issues in social and political philosophy, building upon the critical approaches opened up by the socialist critics and expanding them to include issues such as class, gender, sexuality, race, coloniality, and ecology. We will examine the ways in which these issues intersect and shape our understanding of social and political dynamics. Students will be encouraged to engage in critical thinking and analysis, and to apply the ideas and theories discussed in class to contemporary situations. This course has no prerequisites.

## Learning Outcomes

Students will be able to demonstrate understanding of the major philosophical questions in the area of social philosophy with attention to the historical and conceptual development of these questions and be able to articulate some of the major problems and responses central to this area of philosophy.

# Assignments and Grading

## Grade Scale (% = points)

| A: 93–100% | A–: 90–92% |  |
|--|--|--|
| B+ 87–89% | B: 83–86% | B–: 80–82% |
| C+: 77–79% | C: 73–76% | C–: 70–72% |
| D+: 67–69% | D: 63–66% | D–: 60–62% |
| F: <59% |

## Grade Components

| TOTAL | 110% |
|--|--|
| Participation... | 10% |
| Perusall Annotations | 20% |
| Expert of the Day | 20% |
| Quizzes | 20% |
| Midterm and Final | 20% each (= 40%) |


As you can see, the sum of the grade components amounts to 110% of the grade, or 110 points. This means that there are multiple ways to earn points. For example, if you don’t get a satisfactory grade on one assignment, you can make up for it on another assignment and still earn a high final grade.

## Participation (10 points max.)

Participation is an important component of this course. You can participate in different ways. The most important of these are attending class and engaging in discussions, which requires that you read the assigned texts and come to class ready to talk about your thoughts and questions.

## Perusall Annotations (1 point per reading, 20 points max.)

Post  at least  3 high-quality annotations for each reading assignment on Perusall. Students who fail to post at least 3 high-quality annotations will not receive points for the assignment. The deadline for each reading assignment can be found in the Course Schedule below.

## Expert of the Day (10 points per presentation, 20 points max.)

Students will sign up in advance and come to class prepared to talk about the day’s reading for 3–5 minutes and facilitate discussion. Students should serve as experts twice, once before and once after the midterm.

## Quizzes (5 points each, 20 points max.)

We will have online quizzes throughout the semester that will make up 20% of your final grade (5% each).

## Midterm and Final Exam (20 points each, 40 points max.)

We will have one midterm and one final exam in this course. The midterm will cover all course content up to its date. The final exam will cover all the course content.  

# Course Policies

## Academic Integrity

The university prohibits plagiarism, self-plagiarism, collusion, cheating, and facilitation of academic misconduct. Penalties may range from a grade of “F” to expulsion from the university. Read  [Loyola’s full statement on Academic Integrity](https://www.luc.edu/academics/catalog/undergrad/reg_academicintegrity.shtml).

## Use of Generative Artificial Intelligence

Use of generative AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Google Bard, Bing Chat) is permitted only for brainstorming and checking grammar and style. Using these tools for other purposes (e.g., writing a draft of an assignment, entire sentences or paragraphs, papers, annotation comments, or any other course assignment) is  **not permitted**. You are entirely responsible for all assignments you submit. Unauthorized use of AI will be treated as a violation of Loyola’s Academic Integrity Policy and subject to the same penalties.

## Late Submissions

Except for the midterm and final exams, assignment submissions will be accepted up to seven days after the deadline. However, grades will decrease linearly each day, starting from the original grade point and reaching zero after day seven. For example, if an assignment is worth 10 points by the deadline, it will be worth ~8.75 one day later, ~7.5 two days later, etc. Your grade will be calculated accordingly.
