# Course Description

The question of who we are lies at the heart of philosophical inquiry. From Plato's contemplation of the imperative "know thyself" etched onto the Temple of Apollo at Delphi to Augustine's assertion that truth resides within, Western philosophy has been shaped by the dichotomy between "inner" and "outer" realities and the duality between the self as agent (who knows) and as object (who is known). 

This course delves into the question of whether, in our pursuit of self-knowledge, we should actively aspire to *be* or *become* who we truly are. This is the problem of authenticity, the idea that some elements of ourselves can express who we really are, or that our lives can be led in a way that truly represents our inner nature. 

## Key Questions

- How can we ascertain that we are truly ourselves? 
- Is it possible to exist as anything other than our authentic selves? 
- Should we strive to become more aligned with our true selves? 
- And, fundamentally, is there such a thing as a "self"?

## Course Structure

**Section I: Classical Accounts of Selfhood**  
Exploring the development of concepts like the soul, consciousness, ego, person, and subject.

**Section II: Modern Perspectives on Authenticity**  
Examining the Romantic origins and existential implications of the call for authenticity.

**Section III: Critical Accounts**  
Reading challenges to foundational notions of selfhood, personhood, and subjectivity that put the very possibility of being authentic into question.

## Learning Outcomes

The philosophers we will be reading offer complex accounts that involve questions of knowledge, values, and reality, preparing students to engage critically with fundamental questions about human existence and self-understanding.
