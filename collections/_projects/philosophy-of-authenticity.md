# Course Description

The question of who we are lies at the heart of philosophical inquiry. From Plato's contemplation of the imperative "know thyself" etched onto the Temple of Apollo at Delphi to Augustine's assertion that truth resides within, Western philosophy has been shaped by the dichotomy between "inner" and "outer" realities and the duality between the self as agent (who knows) and as object (who is known). 

This course delves into the question of whether, in our pursuit of self-knowledge, we should actively aspire to *be* or *become* who we truly are. This is the problem of authenticity, the idea that some elements of ourselves can express who we really are, or that our lives can be led in a way that truly represents our inner nature.
