# Course Description

This course provides an introductory exploration of the field of social and political philosophy, which grapples with questions about the nature of society, power, justice, and the state. It offers a critical examination of the foundations of social and political theories, as well as the values that guide them, and is designed for students with an interest in understanding the underlying foundations of modern political systems and the ways in which these foundations shape our contemporary world.

## Course Structure

### Part I: Modern Political Philosophy (Weeks 1–7)
Focus on questions involving:
- The justification of the state
- The concept of natural rights
- The role of private property
- Various forms of government
- Social contract theory and its critics

We will examine the social contract theory of the state and the early socialist and anarchist critiques of this theory.

### Part II: Contemporary Issues (Weeks 9–15)
Building upon critical approaches, we expand to include:
- Class and economic inequality
- Gender and sexuality
- Race and racial justice
- Coloniality and postcolonial theory
- Ecology and environmental justice

We examine how these issues intersect and shape our understanding of social and political dynamics.

## Learning Approach

Students are encouraged to engage in critical thinking and analysis, and to apply the ideas and theories discussed in class to contemporary situations. This course has no prerequisites and is designed to be accessible to students from various academic backgrounds.
