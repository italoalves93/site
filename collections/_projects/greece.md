# Greece in December

I ended up in Greece for one week for a slightly unorthodox reason. Family members were meeting in Paris for the holidays and I needed to fly from Porto Alegre, in Brazil, to Paris. Since it's insanely expensive to fly this route during the holidays, I decided to look for flights departing one week earlier, out of the high season, and to cheaper destinations in Europe where I wouldn't spend too much in lodging and from where I could fly to Paris with a low cost airline. It turns out that Athens was the perfect location. It was affordable, beautiful, and I had never been there.

I spent seven days in Athens, with one day trip to Delphi in the middle. The light in Athens was warm and balmy, and the temperatures were as high as 16Â°C, which proved perfect to enjoy a bougatsa and a coffee under the sun.
