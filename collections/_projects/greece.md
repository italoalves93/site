# Artist Statement

This series captures the interplay of ancient and contemporary life in Greece, where philosophical inquiry began and continues to unfold in daily moments of beauty and contemplation.

The images explore themes of temporality, tradition, and the Mediterranean light that has inspired thinkers for millennia. Each photograph seeks to reveal the philosophical dimensions embedded in everyday Greek lifeâ€”the way light falls across ancient stones, the rhythm of daily routines that connect present to past, and the sense of place that has shaped Western thought.

## Technical Approach

Shot entirely on film using natural light, these images attempt to capture not just the visual beauty of the Greek landscape and architecture, but the quality of light and atmosphere that has drawn philosophers, artists, and writers to these islands for centuries.

## Themes Explored

- **Temporality**: The layering of ancient and modern
- **Light as Philosophy**: How Mediterranean light reveals and conceals
- **Daily Ritual**: The philosophical dimensions of ordinary life
- **Place and Thought**: How landscape shapes consciousness

*This ongoing series was photographed during travels in 2023-2024.*
