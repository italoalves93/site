## About Me

My name is Italo Alves, and I am an instructor in the Philosophy Department at Loyola University Chicago. I also hold a PhD in Philosophy from the same institution.

My areas of interest are Social and Political Theory and Aesthetics, especially where both intersect. My dissertation, *The Social Aesthetics of Recognition*, argues that expressive modes of social action can raise normative claims for recognition. I have written on social and political philosophy and critical theory. My work has been supported by the Newcombe Foundation, the DAAD, Mitacs, Canada's Global Affairs, and Brazil's CNPq, among others.

I am a member of the Society for Phenomenology and Existential Philosophy (SPEP) and the American Philosophical Association (APA). I have held visiting research and study positions at Concordia University of Edmonton, Carleton University, Université de Montréal, Goethe-Universität Frankfurt, and the Centre Marc Bloch in Berlin. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Social and Legal Studies and a Master's in Philosophy from the Catholic University in Porto Alegre (PUCRS), Brazil.

I studied Art History for about two years. In addition to Brazil, I have also lived in Canada, Germany, and the US. I have a Warburgian interest in the relations between high and popular culture in everyday life, and I have written a few articles on this topic (they can be found on my blog and my Medium). I am the co-editor of Revista Porto Alegre, an online cultural review that publishes book reviews, interviews, and articles on arts and humanities. I like to swim.
