Photography serves as both artistic expression and philosophical inquiry, capturing moments that reveal deeper truths about human experience and our relationship with place.

Through the camera, I explore how landscape shapes consciousness, how light reveals the hidden dimensions of everyday life, and how the act of seeing can become a form of contemplative practice. Each project represents an extended meditation on place, time, and the philosophical implications of visual experience.
